     * \brief Utility class for extracting execution statistics
     * from a TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented and an instrumented TPGGraph.
     *
     * The main method of this class is analyzeExecution(), which will :
     *  - retrieve from a TPGGraph the instrumented values and compute
     *  average execution statistics.
     *  - compute execution statistics for every inference done with a
     * TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented.
     *  - create distributions from statistics of analyzed traces.
     *
     * Before analyzing or even starting any inference, you must :
     *  - use a TPGGraph associated to a TPGFactoryInstrumented.
     *  - use a TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented that will execute the TPGGraph.
     *  - clear any previous instrumented data :
     *      --> for the TPGGraph, use
     * TPGFactoryInstrumented::resetTPGGraphCounters().
     *      --> for the TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented, use its method
     * TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented::clearTraceHistory(). Otherwise, the
     * results won't have any meaning. If you have never executed the TPGGraph
     * or the TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented, resetting them isn't required.
     *
     * You can then execute the TPG for as many inferences as you like.
     *
     * Then, use analyzeExecution() with the TPGGraph and
     * TPGExecutionEngineInstrumented, and access the statistics using the
     * provided getters and setters.
     *
     * Warning : the class deduces the number of inferences based on the sum
     * of evaluation each root vertices had. If you executed your TPGGraph
     * starting from multiple roots, then remember that the average statistics
     * are based on ALL inferences, regardless of the root vertices used.
     *
     * The Json exporter is designed to be used after a call to
     * analyzeExecution(). Just call writeStatsToJson() to export statistics in
     * a file with json format.
